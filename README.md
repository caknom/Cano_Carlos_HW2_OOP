# ü•ã Fighters OOP Webpage  
This project is a simple interactive webpage where users can create and view fighter profiles using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Fighters with over 20 wins are marked as **Champion Fighters** and visually highlighted on the page.

## Installation  
Clone or download the repository from my repositories.

## Usage  
* Open the unzipped folder on your device.  
* Launch the `index.html` file in any modern browser.  
* Fill out the fighter form and click **‚ÄúAdd Fighter‚Äù** to see it displayed dynamically on the page.

## Project Summary  
The Fighters webpage was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, applying OOP with ES6 class syntax. When a user adds a fighter, a new object is created. If the fighter has more than 20 wins, they are given the status of *Champion Fighter*, shown with a unique color and a title count. The app updates the DOM in real time without requiring page reloads.
